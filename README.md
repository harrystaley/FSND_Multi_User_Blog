# FSND_Multi_User_Blog
This is a web site that has the purpose of being a muulti user blog.

This site uses google app engine to serve the content of the site and all of hte content on it.

To install the google app engine SDK go to https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#null .

Once installed sign up for a google app engine acount by following the instructions located at https://sites.google.com/site/gdevelopercodelabs/app-engine/creating-your-app-engine-account

Once you are all set up you are welcome to fork my code and set up your very own multi user blog.


More features and enhancement are forthcoming so stay tuned for more.

I plan on implementing bcrypt as well as updating the UI to include more styling as well as likes for comments as well.
